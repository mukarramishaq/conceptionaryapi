,,aphrodisia,"a concept by which one can grasp what was recognized as the ""ethical substance"" in sexual behavior",Foucault,Michel,,"I will consider four notions that are often encountered in the reflec­tion on sexual ethics: the notion of aphrodisia, through which one can grasp what was recognized as the ""ethical substance"" in sexual behavior; the notion of ""use,"" of chrësis, which allows one to perceive the type of subjection that the practice of pleasures had to undergo in order to be morally valorized; the notion of enkrateia, of mastery, that defines the attitude that was required with respect to oneself in order to make oneself into an ethical subject; and lastly, the notion of ""mod­eration,"" of sophrosyne, that characterized the ethical subject in his fulfillment. It should thus be possible to determine what structured the moral experience of sexual pleasures—its on­ tology, its deontology, its ascetics, its teleology. (37)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
